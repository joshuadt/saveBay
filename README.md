Project 3: Save the Bay by Joshua Thatcher

# project overview
Despite being a city known for it's progressive stance on human rights and environmental awareness, the natural habitat of the San Francisco Bay's coastal regions and inlands has been destroyed by up to 90% of it's historic capacity, causing the endangerment of over 35 species in the Golden Gate Park System alone: more than Yosemite, Yellowstone, Sequoia, and Kings Canyon combined. In order to raise awareness on this habitat problem, I have designed a website built around a habitat restoration event that I have named "Save the Bay". 

As an avid animal lover, this is a project that is close to my heart and is healing to my inner child that wanted to be a veterinarian growing up. This project has much more significance than simply a love for animals however, as species endangerment has an impact on not just other animal species, but humans and the environment we all share together. In ecosystems where plant biodiversity is often controlled by other animal species, like in the case of otters being a keystone species that keeps urchin population under control to protect kelp forests, the protection of these animals is ever important. The world we live in is interconnected in endless ways, and so I wanted to create a website featuring this event to help bring awareness to the topic and connect people with ways that they can donate their time or funds to help restore the local habitat that we share.

The event takes place over the course of three days, with each day having a central theme that ties the different activities together. The first day is animal centered, featuring numerous local rescue and release organizations such as the Yggdrasil Urban Wildlife Rescue (YUWR). These organizations will have booths set up where they can show (but not allow touch) the various animals that they take in and foster, often due to dislocation as a result of habitat loss. This first day will also feature boat tours of the San Francisco Bay Marine Habitat, to learn about the coastal environment that is home to numerous species from local research organizations, and hopefully get the chance to see some wild animals as well. The second day is a more experiential day, with local hikes being planned which take event goers through protected parts of the Presidio and Golden Gate Parks area to learn more about the on-land habitat that is a bit closer to home for most people. This will lead into an exhibit at the end of the day that will be set up with seemlessly integrated screens to emulate some of the various habitats that are being threatened due to development, which would then transition to the San Francisco Natural Environment as it historically was pre-development and portray these same habitats of the Bay area as they are now. This will point towards the last day, which is a bit more of a call to action, encouraging people to get connected and make whatever difference they can. This last day will be filled with various local habitat restoration organizations such as the San Francisco Habitat Stewards, and will feature hands on activities where attendees of all ages can learn about various ways they can make an impact by learning about and planting indigenous beneficial flora, volunteering for full-on habitat restoration activities, or simply donate. There will also be a merchandise shop open all day for each of the three days, sporting small engraved pins featuring various stylized indigenous animals, premium plush stuffed animals, apparel, and more.

# technical overview
For this website, I knew from the beginning that I wanted to design the website around wildlife and habitat restoration, but more research was needed in order to gain insight into local organizations and foundations that focused on habitat restoration, the San Francisco Bay Area's natural habitat history, as well as looking at similar websites for inspiration. Research was also conducted prior to any sort of design work regarding appropriate typeface choices, color schemes, logo design styles, iconography, and layouts. For color schemes, I finalized on an earthy natural palette that focused on muted forest greens and a creamy sand hue in addition to black and white. A nature pattern featuring ferns and other flora was also chosen as a background texture to tie the webpages together, toned down to a shallow 10% opacity in order to reduce visual clutter and better increase contrast. For typefaces, an organic and textured typeface "Brushberry Sans Two, Regular" was chosen for branding and headlines, while "Trade Gothic Next SR/LT Pro" was chosen in various weights for the body and subheaders. This secondary typeface contrasts "Brushberry" with a more traditional sans serif, featuring thin uniform strokes to contrast with "Brushberry's" thicker, more calligraphic strokes

Once the research stage had been completed, and a general style and overall theme had been settled on, I then moved into a brief sketching phase for the webpage layout on paper. This was also when I began to sketch and refine my logo, Otto the Otter. After a layout had been chosen, I then translated my idea from paper to Figma, creating high-fidelity wireframes that included stock images I was planning to use, and implementing the color scheme and typefaces I had chosen. Some minimal prototype interactivity was additionally added to the wireframes, such as a free scroll and linked nav buttons, to better emulate the planned design.

At this point, after feedback had been received in order to tweak some aspects that weren't working as well, I moved into HTML coding, placing all of the text and images that I had planned to use. Only then would I move on to CSS to begin implementing the color palette, typefaces, styling, and layout in my wireframes.
